# PacMen-Exercise

## Description
Time to unleash a chaotic crowd of Pac-Men by running the page, and then clicking the "Add Pac-Man" and "Start Game" buttons. If you feel overwhelmed by the Pac-Men frenzy, you can click "Freeze One" or "Freeze All" to stop them.

### Improvements
• Updated new colors to match Pac-Men color palette <br />
• Added new button "Freeze One" to stop one Pac-Man from moving <br />
• Added new button "Freeze All" to stop all Pac-Men at once

## How to run
• Run https://tylerthejester.github.io/PacMen-Exercise/ in your browser <br />
• Click "Add Pac-Man" to add a Pac-Man, you can add as many Pac-Men as you would like <br />
• Click "Start Game" to make the Pac-Men run, you can accelerate the Pac-Men by continue clicking the same button <br />
• Click "Freeze One" to stop one Pac-Man at a time <br />
• Click "Freeze All" to stop all Pac-Men at once

## Roadmap of future improvements
• Add a frame below the buttons so the page will look cleaner <br />

• Add "Pac-Men" title above the frame <br />
• Add dots so Pac-Men can eat
