# PacMen-Exercise

## Description

Time to unleash a chaotic crowd of Pac-Men by running the page, and then clicking the "Add Pac-Man" and "Start Game" buttons. If you feel overwhelmed by the Pac-Men frenzy, you can click "Freeze One" or "Freeze All" to stop them.

### Improvements
• Updated new colors to match Pac-Men color palette <br />
• Added new button "Freeze One" to stop one Pac-Man from moving <br />
• Added new button "Freeze All" to stop all Pac-Men at once
